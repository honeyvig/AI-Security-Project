# AI-Security-Project
 custom AI security platform and online panel to integrate into our customer's security systems.

An example product will be provided and we will ask for an offer based on such an example. We have multiple developers at the moment but looking for a better priced alternative to take lead on this new project and perhaps 1-2 more ahead.

=====================
To create a custom AI security platform and online panel that integrates into your customer's security systems, you'll need to develop several components including an AI model for threat detection, an API for communication with the security systems, a web panel for user interaction, and the necessary integration for deploying the platform in a real-world environment.

Here’s a high-level Python-based solution for the AI security platform that can analyze security data (e.g., camera feeds, logs, alerts) and provide a user-friendly panel for monitoring, controlling, and analyzing the security situation.
Steps for Implementation:

    AI Model for Threat Detection:
        This could involve anomaly detection, facial recognition, intrusion detection, or other types of security monitoring.

    Backend API:
        A Flask or FastAPI application to serve the AI model and handle the communication with external security systems (e.g., cameras, logs).

    Web Frontend (Online Panel):
        A frontend built with technologies like React or Vue.js to display real-time alerts, logs, and system status. It will communicate with the backend API to interact with the system.

    Integration:
        Use APIs to integrate with the customer’s existing security systems, whether it’s camera feeds, intrusion detection systems, or security logs.

Step 1: Install Dependencies

We’ll need the following Python libraries:

    Flask or FastAPI: For building the backend API.
    TensorFlow or PyTorch: For AI models (e.g., threat detection).
    OpenCV: For working with video streams or images.
    SQLAlchemy: For database integration to store user data and logs.

pip install flask tensorflow opencv-python fastapi sqlalchemy

Step 2: AI Threat Detection Model (e.g., using OpenCV for Video Surveillance)

For simplicity, let's assume we are using a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, MobileNet) to detect unauthorized intrusions or abnormal activities in a live camera feed.

# ai_security_model.py
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, MobileNet, etc.)
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromDarknet("yolov3.cfg", "yolov3.weights")

# Function to perform real-time threat detection
def detect_threat(frame):
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 1/255.0, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), swapRB=True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
    output_layers = [layer_names[i - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]
    outputs = net.forward(output_layers)

    threats = []
    for output in outputs:
        for detection in output:
            scores = detection[5:]
            class_id = np.argmax(scores)
            confidence = scores[class_id]
            if confidence > 0.5:  # threshold for detection
                threats.append((class_id, confidence))
    return threats

Step 3: Backend API Using Flask

This API will handle real-time data coming from the security systems, such as camera feeds or logs, and will integrate with the AI detection model to process the data.

# app.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import cv2
from ai_security_model import detect_threat

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/detect', methods=['POST'])
def detect_intrusion():
    try:
        # Get the image or video feed as input
        data = request.files['image']
        file = data.read()

        # Convert the file to a numpy array (for image processing)
        np_arr = np.frombuffer(file, np.uint8)
        frame = cv2.imdecode(np_arr, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

        # Perform threat detection
        threats = detect_threat(frame)

        return jsonify({"threats": threats}), 200
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500

@app.route('/api/status', methods=['GET'])
def get_status():
    # Example of returning system status or logs
    return jsonify({"status": "active", "last_scan": "2024-12-16 10:00"}), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 4: Database Integration for User Data and Logs (Optional)

For logging detected threats or storing user credentials, you can use SQLAlchemy to manage database operations.

# models.py (Database models for user and logs)
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class SecurityLog(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    threat_type = db.Column(db.String(50))
    confidence = db.Column(db.Float)
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime)

# Example for inserting logs
def log_threat(threat_type, confidence):
    new_log = SecurityLog(threat_type=threat_type, confidence=confidence)
    db.session.add(new_log)
    db.session.commit()

Step 5: Web Frontend (Online Panel)

You can use frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular to create the user interface. This frontend will interact with the Flask API to get real-time alerts and system status.

Here’s an example using React:

// Frontend (React) Example
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

const SecurityPanel = () => {
  const [threats, setThreats] = useState([]);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('');

  const handleDetectClick = async () => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
    formData.append('image', fileInput.files[0]);

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/api/detect', formData, {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
      });
      setThreats(response.data.threats);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error detecting threats:', error);
    }
  };

  const handleGetStatusClick = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('http://localhost:5000/api/status');
      setStatus(response.data.status);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching status:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Security System Panel</h1>
      <input type="file" id="fileInput" />
      <button onClick={handleDetectClick}>Detect Threat</button>
      <button onClick={handleGetStatusClick}>Get System Status</button>

      <div>
        <h2>Detected Threats</h2>
        <ul>
          {threats.map((threat, index) => (
            <li key={index}>Type: {threat[0]}, Confidence: {threat[1]}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Status: {status}</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SecurityPanel;

Step 6: Integration

Once your backend API and frontend are ready, integrate them into your customer’s security systems:

    Use video streams from cameras or logs from existing systems.
    Ensure the backend communicates seamlessly with these systems.
    The AI model can provide real-time threat analysis based on the incoming data, and alerts can be sent to the frontend panel.

Step 7: Deployment and Monitoring

Finally, you can deploy the backend API on a cloud service like AWS, GCP, or Azure for better scalability. Dockerize the application for easy deployment across different environments.

docker build -t ai-security-app .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ai-security-app

For ongoing monitoring and management, you can use services like AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, or ELK Stack to track performance and alert on issues.
Summary

This code structure provides:

    AI threat detection via a pre-trained model.
    Backend API (Flask) to interact with security systems and process data.
    Frontend panel using React to display real-time alerts and system status.
    Database integration for logging and storing security data.

This solution can be customized further for your specific use case and integrated into the existing customer security infrastructure. You can also expand it to include more advanced features such as facial recognition, anomaly detection, and integration with other IoT security devices.
